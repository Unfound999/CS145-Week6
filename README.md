## Description
This repository contains three separate programs, with the two extra programs being done for extra credit. (As Darrell suggested, each extra program after one could be extra credit.)
The programs are as listed:
* Towers Of Hanoi (TowersOfHanoi.java)
* Pascal's Triangle (PascalTriangle.java)
* Find Least Common Denominator (FindLCD.java) 

## For Extra Credit
* We wrote three separate program each that uses recursion, as suggested.
* Darrell suggested that Pascal Triangle would be difficult entirely with recursion, as such, for extra credit, we have done this.
* In Pascal's Triangle, Javadoc comments were used.
* Tower Of Hanoi included a text ui.
* Tower of Hanoi included a hash map.
* LCD program calculates the entire fraction, not just the LCD.
